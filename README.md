Hello and nice to meet you, hope you can find all requested details represented within this simple app, made in a short amount of time.

You're going to find two main folders:
 - "myJsBack" where I've built a little server for port 8000 to create the OpenAI api calls. There's a .env file where you have to add your own OpenAI api key like this MY_OPENAI_API_KEY='YOUR_OPENAI_KEY'
 - "project" where you can access the React application itself where you'll find another .env file to set up the Google API key, you must assign yours to VITE_MY_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY='YOUR_GOOGLE_KEY'

 
 Once this is complete auth configurations are done, and you can start checking Component folders and Context created to hold global information.
 For complete functionality please make sure both local server and React app are running.
